# Offline feature importance

PR-ML-1 adds an **offline-only** feature importance layer over replay-derived trade matrices such as `trade_feature_matrix.jsonl`.

## What it does

The offline analysis module:

- loads replay matrices conservatively
- derives explicit offline targets
- computes per-feature and grouped feature rankings
- reports sample size, missingness, exclusions, and caveats
- writes machine-readable JSON plus a markdown summary

## What it does not do

This layer is intentionally **not** an online model.

It does **not**:

- influence runtime entry, exit, or promotion decisions
- auto-tune configs
- auto-apply recommendations
- claim causal proof from associations

All outputs are marked with:

- `analysis_only = true`
- `not_for_online_decisioning = true`
- `association_only = true`

## Supported offline targets

### `profitable_trade_flag`
Binary target derived from positive `net_pnl_pct`.

### `trend_success_flag`
Binary target for stronger trend-like outcomes using a conservative combination of:

- `trend_survival_15m`
- `mfe_pct_240s`
- `net_pnl_pct`
- `time_to_first_profit_sec`

### `fast_failure_flag`
Binary target for rapid bad outcomes / false positives using a conservative combination of:

- negative `net_pnl_pct` with short `hold_sec`
- weak `mae_pct_240s`
- early-failure exit reason hints

These targets exist only for offline calibration and interpretation.

## Methods used

This PR keeps the methodology lightweight and reproducible:

- **numeric features:** absolute normalized mean gap between positive and negative target rows
- **categorical features:** weighted deviation from the baseline target rate by category

The output separates target definitions, per-feature rows, grouped summaries, and warnings so humans can inspect the evidence quality.

## Feature groups

At minimum the analysis groups features into:

- bundle features
- cluster features
- continuation features
- wallet features
- X features
- regime features
- exit features
- risk features
- friction features
- meta features

Grouped importance helps reviewers see whether signal families look broadly useful, weak, noisy, or suspicious.

## Honesty / caveats

Every output includes:

- sample size
- positive / negative class counts
- feature coverage ratio
- missing ratio
- excluded row counts
- malformed row counts
- warnings for low sample or low coverage

Important caveats:

- association does not imply causation
- sparse replay coverage can distort rankings
- imbalanced targets can overstate weak patterns
- low-coverage features should be treated as diagnostic hints only

## Artifacts

Typical output artifacts:

- `feature_importance.json`
- `feature_importance_summary.md`

Smoke outputs are written to:

- `data/smoke/offline_feature_importance.json`
- `data/smoke/offline_feature_importance_summary.md`

## Smoke path

Run the deterministic smoke path locally:

```bash
python scripts/offline_feature_importance_smoke.py
```

The smoke path uses fixture-backed replay matrix data, writes offline artifacts, and prints a compact JSON summary.

## Online-vs-calibration separation

Entry-time / sanctioned decision-support features may feed runtime or offline entry-support analysis. Post-trade outcome fields must stay calibration-only and must not be used as model inputs. Excluded leakage / outcome fields include at least:

- `net_pnl_pct`
- `gross_pnl_pct`
- `hold_sec`
- `exit_reason_final`
- `mfe_pct` / `mae_pct`
- `mfe_pct_240s` / `mae_pct_240s`
- `trend_survival_15m` / `trend_survival_60m`
- `time_to_first_profit_sec`
- `exit_decision`, `exit_flags`, `exit_warnings`

These remain valid offline targets / diagnostics but not legal training features for entry-support models.
