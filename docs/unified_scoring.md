# PR-6 Unified scoring

`unified_scoring` merges outputs from shortlist, X-validation, enrichment, and rug assessment into a deterministic `final_score` and candidate route.

## Formula

```text
final_score =
  onchain_core
  + early_signal_bonus
  + x_validation_bonus
  - rug_penalty
  - spam_penalty
  + confidence_adjustment
```

`final_score` is clamped to `[0, 100]`.

## Component caps

- `onchain_core`: `0..45`
- `early_signal_bonus`: `0..25`
- `x_validation_bonus`: `0..14`
- `rug_penalty`: derived from `rug_score * 30` (+ verdict modifiers)
- `spam_penalty`: `0..8`

## Normalizers

- `normalize_unit_interval`
- `normalize_capped`
- `normalize_inverse`
- `normalize_log_scaled`

All normalizers are deterministic, safe on `None`, and capped to `[0, 1]`.

## Routing thresholds

- `IGNORE` if score below `UNIFIED_SCORE_WATCH_THRESHOLD`
- `WATCHLIST` if score in `[WATCH, ENTRY)`
- `ENTRY_CANDIDATE` if score >= `UNIFIED_SCORE_ENTRY_THRESHOLD`

## Downgrade and override rules

Hard overrides to `IGNORE`:

- `rug_verdict == IGNORE`
- `mint_revoked == false`
- `dev_sell_pressure_5m >= RUG_DEV_SELL_PRESSURE_HARD`
- critical fields missing when fail-open is disabled

Downgrades from `ENTRY_CANDIDATE` to `WATCHLIST`:

- degraded X status
- partial enrichment
- partial rug status
- heuristic-heavy score context

Near-threshold partial-evidence reconciliation:

- `final_score` stays penalized and remains the conservative execution-facing score basis
- `partial_review_score` is review-only and reconstructs the score before `partial_evidence_penalty` and `low_confidence_evidence_penalty` were applied
- if a token would otherwise route to `IGNORE`, has partial enrichment/rug/continuation evidence, has no hard blocker, and `partial_review_score` lands within `UNIFIED_SCORE_PARTIAL_REVIEW_BUFFER` below the watch threshold, routing upgrades it to `WATCHLIST`
- this adds the warning `watchlist_partial_evidence_review`
- this is a narrow operator-review path, not an entry relaxation, and it never bypasses hard overrides or critical-missing fail-closed checks

## Heuristic discount policy

Heuristic fields (`holder_entropy_est`, `first50_holder_conc_est`, and uncertain migration speed) receive a confidence multiplier defaulting to `0.75`, floored by `UNIFIED_SCORE_HEURISTIC_CONFIDENCE_FLOOR`.

## Artifacts

- `data/processed/scored_tokens.json`
- `data/processed/score_events.jsonl`

The event log is append-only and emits:

- `score_started`
- `score_components_computed`
- `score_routed`
- `score_downgraded`
- `score_hard_override`
- `score_completed`
